# SCT_ML_1

ABOUT

This project shows a simple machine learning model that predicts house prices based on user inputs like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using Linear Regression.

FEATURES

1)Predicts house price by inputing
   .Square Footage
   .Number of Bedrooms
   .Number of Bathrooms

2)Uses LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

3)Graph to compare prices with square footage.

4)Easy to customize.

TECHNOLOGY USED

1)Python(Preferablly version 3.10 or advanced)
2)Pandas
3)scikit-learn
4)Matplotlib


SAMPLE OUTPUT
